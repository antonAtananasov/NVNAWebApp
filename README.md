**Introduction**

The present state of web applications is SPA (Single Page Applications). 
Through this technology, we achieve better user experience and optimization of data loading. 
For such a system to work, it relies on API Endpoints, which act as the intermediary layer between the data and the interface. 
Behind a single URL, there can be a lot of logic that prepares the data for display on our screen. 
The front end does not care whether we use SQL or No-SQL databases, Node.js, PHP, Python, or C#, which in turn makes reusability and integration easy. 
Front End Frameworks, on the other hand, facilitate working with the DOM and provide a file system that follows best practices for writing applications.

**Task:**

Develop an application that provides API Endpoints for use in a Front-End Framework and, through Angular/React/Vue.js, 
displays the data and makes it accessible to users. The coursework project should be created based on one of the proposed 
topics or you can present an option based on your own idea. The coursework tasks are group-based. The groups should consist of 
a maximum of 3 people and no less than 2 people (if it is not possible to form a group of 3). Evaluation is done on a point-based system, 
at the discretion of the instructor, based on whether the criteria outlined in the document below are met. 
Bonus points are not awarded for attendance in lectures or exercises, but attendance will be taken into account when assigning 
a grade that falls between two levels. You have the full right to interpret the tasks as you wish. What does this mean? 
_Each group can understand the task differently and develop its own extended/modified idea._

**Scoring Scheme:**

20 points* - CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
25 points* - Use of Angular/Vue/React to consume the CRUD operations  
10 points* - Use of a database (MySQL)  
10 points - Use of TypeScript in the Backend  
15 points - Use of OOP in the Backend  
10 points - Good UX/UI (Design)  
10 points - Adding functionalities not specified in the task (use of Git/GitHub, use of packages to improve and facilitate work)  
_The tasks marked with an asterisk (*) must be completed to achieve at least a minimum grade._  

**Grading Scheme:**

90 points =+ Excellent  
80 points =+ Very Good  
70 points =+ Good  
60 points =+ Satisfactory  
50 points =+ Poor  
_Each member will be evaluated individually based on their participation in the project. Points are awarded upon defense of the work._
